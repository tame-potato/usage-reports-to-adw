# Usage2ADW - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Usage and Cost Reports to Autonomous Database Tool

## Getting Started

Usage2adw is a tool which uses the Python SDK to extract the usage and cost reports from your tenant and load it to Oracle Autonomous Database. (DbaaS can be used as well)
Authentication to OCI by User or instance principals.

It uses APEX for Visualization and generates Daily e-mail report.

**DISCLAIMER - This is not an official Oracle application,  It does not supported by Oracle Support, It should NOT be used for utilization calculation purposes, and rather OCI's official
[cost analysis](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/costanalysisoverview.htm) 
and [usage reports](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Billing/Concepts/usagereportsoverview.htm) features should be used instead.**

## Usage Reports Overview

A usage report is a comma-separated value (CSV) file that can be used to get a detailed breakdown of resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for audit or invoice reconciliation.

## How Usage Reports Work

The usage report is automatically generated daily, and is stored in an Oracle-owned Object Storage bucket. It contains one row per each Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource (such as instance, Object Storage bucket, VNIC) per hour along with consumption information, metadata, and tags. Usage reports generally contain 24 hours of usage data, although occasionally a usage report may contain late-arriving data that is older than 24 hours.
